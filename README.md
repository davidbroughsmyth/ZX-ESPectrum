# ZX-ESPectrum

An emulation of the ZX-Spectrum computer on an ESP32 chip with VGA output based on bitluni's driver.

## Features

- VGA output, 8 or 16 bits.
- Beeper digital output.
- Accurate Z80 emulation.
- Spectrum 16/48 achitecture emulation without PSRAM.
- Spectrum 128/+2/+3 architecture emulation with PSRAM.
- PS/2 Keyboard.
- VGA OSD menu: Configuration, and architecture selection, ROM and SNA.
- Tape save and loading.
- SNA snapshot loading.
- Internal SPIFFS support.

## Work in progress

- AY-3-8910 emulation and sound output with dedicated chip.
- SD card support.
- DivIDE emulation.
- Dedicated motherboard design.
- Joystick support.
- USB keyboard.
- OTA: Over the Air updates.

## Compiling and installing

At this point we only support GNU/Linux and MacOS/X. It may work at Windoze too but we don't know.

#### Install platformIO:

- They have an extension for Atom and VSCode, and this is [the webpage](https://platformio.org/).
- Select you board.
- Install Bitluni's ESP32Lib.

#### Softlink and customize platformio.ini

```bash
ln -s platformio.ini.linux platformio.ini
# or in osx
ln -s platformio.ini.osx platformio.ini
```

#### Copy boot.cfg

```bash
cp data/boot.cfg.orig boot.cfg
```

#### Upload the data filesystem

`Run Other Task > PIO Upload Filesystem Image`

#### Compile and flash it

Right arrow at the bottom icon bar or `Tasks > Run Build Task > PlatformIO: Build` and `Tasks > PlatformIO: Upload`.

## Hardware configuration and pinout

Comming soon...
